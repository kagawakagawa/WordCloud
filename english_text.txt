In this paper, we consider a nonparametric adaptive
software rejuvenation schedule under a random censored data.
For u failure time data and v random censored data, we
formulate upper and lower bounds of the predictive system
availability based on a nonparametric predictive inference (NPI).
Then, we derive adaptive rejuvenation policies which maximizes
the upper or lower bound. In simulation experiments, we show
that estimates of the software rejuvenation schedule are updated
by acquisition of new failure data, and converge to the theoretical
optimal solution.
